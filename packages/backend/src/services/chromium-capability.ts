/**
 * Is a headless Chromium launch usable in this process?
 *
 * The probe matters because `chromium.launch()` blocks the Bun event loop
 * while it waits for the browser handshake. Measured on Windows + Bun 1.3.13
 * with playwright-core 1.59.1: the handshake never completes, and during the
 * wait no timer fires and no HTTP request progresses — one thumbnail render
 * freezes the whole backend, which is what left the project view stuck on its
 * loading state. A per-request timeout cannot help, because the timer that
 * would fire it is blocked too.
 *
 * So the launch is attempted once in a CHILD process, where a blocked loop
 * costs nothing, and every in-process render is gated on that answer.
